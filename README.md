# Portfolio 2.0
## Recreating my portfolio page with the new skills I've learned!
### Aspen Hollyer

----

This page marks my first real dynamic website, built with Django. Though still a work in progress, this site represents a massive amount of learning and a huge improvement from my first portfolio page.

----
### Strengths:
- Used a complex framework to build a dynamic page
- Learned to administer and deploy to a server on AWS
- Applied Python skills to create an e-mail form & blog application
- **Design:** I moved away from basic bootstrap and worked on a custom responsive design

---
### Areas to Improve:
- Explore HTML5 canvas rather than divs for drawing app
- Use templating more effectively (inherit from some sort of base)
- **Design:** Continue to improve responsiveness & accessibility
