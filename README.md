# Portfolio 2.0
## Recreating my personal site with the new skills I've learned!
### Aspen Hollyer

----

This page marks my first real dynamic website, built with Python/Django. Though still a work in progress, this site represents a massive amount of learning and a huge improvement from my [first portfolio page](https://github.com/ahollyer/portfolio).

----
### Strengths:
- Used a complex framework to build a dynamic page
- Learned to administer and deploy to a server using AWS Lightsail
- Applied Python skills to create an e-mail form & blog application
- **Design:** I moved away from bootstrap and worked on a custom responsive design

---
### Areas to Improve:
- ~~Explore HTML5 canvas rather than divs for drawing app~~ Built [Shared Chalkboard](http://chalkboard.aspenhollyer.com)
- ~~Use templating more effectively (inherit from some sort of base)~~ Done!
- Try implementing CSS grid
- Learn Sass and use it to declutter my css files
- **Design:** Continue to improve responsiveness & accessibility
